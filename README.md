## Getting Started

### Install

You can also host Octobox yourself! See [the installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)
for installation instructions and details regarding deployment to Heroku, Docker, and more.

### Desktop usage

You can run Octobox locally as a desktop app too if you'd like, using [Nativefier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativefier):

```bash
npm install -g nativefier
nativefier "https://octobox.io" # Or your own self-hosted URL
```

This will build a local application (.exe, .app, etc) and put it in your current folder, ready to use.

### Web extension

You can also install the cross-browser [Octobox Web Extension](https://github.com/tfrommen/octobox-web-extension). It is available for [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octobox-web-extension/efhkcafmbonnomnimilnephjgeccffdn) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/octobox-web-extension/), but you can also use it with other browsers that support web extensions.

## Requirements

[Web notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications) must be enabled in your GitHub settings for Octobox to work. To receive vulnerability notifications, you must enable them as well.

## Viewing comment threads

Octobox's thread view support is currently in public beta. To enable it select 'on octobox' from the 'Open notifications' menu in `/settings`.

Threads need to be synchronised in order to view them in Octobox. Some notifications will still show the `:link-external:` icon from the notification window if they do not have an associated thread or have yet to synchronise one.

## Keyboard shortcuts

You can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate and perform certain actions:

 - `a` - Select/deselect all
 - `r` or `.` - Refresh list
 - `j` - Move down the list
 - `k` - Move up the list
 - `s` - Star current notification
 - `x` - Mark/unmark current notification
 - `y` or `e` - Archive current/marked notification(s)
 - `m` - Mute current/marked notification(s)
 - `d` - Mark current/marked notification(s) as read here and on GitHub
 - `o` or `Enter` - Open current notification in a new window

Press `?` for the help menu.

## Viewing comment threads

Octobox's thread view support is currently in public beta. To enable it select 'on octobox' from the 'Open notifications' menu in `/settings`.

Threads need to be synchronised in order to view them in Octobox. Some notifications will still show the `:link-external:` icon from the notification window if they do not have an associated thread or have yet to synchronise one.

## Viewing comment threads

Octobox's thread view support is currently in public beta. To enable it select 'on octobox' from the 'Open notifications' menu in `/settings`.

Threads need to be synchronised in order to view them in Octobox. Some notifications will still show the `:link-external:` icon from the notification window if they do not have an associated thread or have yet to synchronise one.

## Keyboard shortcuts

You can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate and perform certain actions:

 - `a` - Select/deselect all
 - `r` or `.` - Refresh list
 - `j` - Move down the list
 - `k` - Move up the list
 - `s` - Star current notification
 - `x` - Mark/unmark current notification
 - `y` or `e` - Archive current/marked notification(s)
 - `m` - Mute current/marked notification(s)
 - `d` - Mark current/marked notification(s) as read here and on GitHub
 - `o` or `Enter` - Open current notification in a new window

Press `?` for the help menu.
